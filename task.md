# Task

Think up ways to make a spinning sun in Python.

## Constraints
- Must be runnable with standard Python libraries or pip-installable packages
- Should be a complete, self-contained approach
- Aim for approaches that feel meaningfully different from each other

## Scoring (for the reviewer)
An idea is TOO SIMILAR if it uses the same core library AND the same core technique as an existing idea.
An idea is NOVEL ENOUGH if it uses a different library, a different visual technique, or a meaningfully different architectural approach.
